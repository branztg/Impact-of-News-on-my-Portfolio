# News Driven Investments #

# Project Overview 
   Data Analysis research project 1 was completed for Northwestern's Fintech Bootcamp first project. News Driven Investments involves the collection of news articles and examines the data to see the impact on 10 stock and crypto currencies that we chose to include in our Finance folio. The projects goal is to analyze the correlation between news coverage and market fluctuations. The project consists of gathering data using APIs, plotting information that was gathered and preforming a through analysis on them. Python and Pandas were both utilized. 
 
# Getting Started
   This project was completed utilizing Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebook contains python code and displays our Projects findings. There is no need to install libraries as you will only need to open a "IPYNB" file to display the Python code containing our projects results. This is a research project, and the analysis is here available on the Readme file.

# Motovation & Summary
The project involves collecting news articles and examining their impact on the stock and cryptocurrency prices of a specific portfolio. 
The goal is to analyze the correlation between news coverage and market fluctuations. 
Specifically, the analysis aims to determine what to buy during periods of good and bad news

# Package Requirements and Versions
pip install x ; where 'x' is the package listed below:
python == 3.7.13+
numpy == 1.21.5
pandas == 1.3.5+
hvplot == 0.7.3
matplotlib == 3.5.1
Hvplot == 2.0.9

# Files Navigation
   Main branch is a Directory that contains all images and plots that were created and utilized in Jupyter Notebook, Data Exploration, API connections, graphs deployed applications include Python, Panda’s, Alpaca, Hvplot, Matplotlib, Python Syntax, Variables,  Cleaning of the data consists of the visualization of numbers, correlation and more.

# Purpose of Use
   Our team decided that Project One will consist of the investigation of the effects of the news on the stock and crypto currency market we examined different news events spanning over a five-year period. We examined the effects both good and bad on the stock and crypto currency market. This may be used to anticipate and plot the past your finance folio.

# The periods of analyzed include:
We chose a period of 5 years:

# Look at 10 stocks and crypto currancies in my Financefolio.
Amazon AMZN
Google GOOG
Tesla TSLA
Mcdonalds MCD
Exxon Mobil XOM

Bitcoin BTC
Solana SOL
LiteCoin LTC
DOGE
Ethereum ETH

# Data Pre-Processing/Gathering Steps (Cleaning and Manipulation)
Import necessary libraries(pandas , alpaca)
Enter API and secret keys
Choose tickers, startdate-enddate, and timeframe
Called Stock data from Alpaca’s API
Navigate and Clean data
Drop all columns except close price
Set index to data date
Use Close Price as our y-axis, dates as x-axis
Organize into a dataframe
Choose tickers, call data, clean data for Cryptocurrencies
Concatenate Stocks and Crypto Dataframes
Visualize results using hvplot

# Visuals and Explanations
Using line graphs, 
    5 cryptocurrencies (BTC, SOL, LTC, DOGE, ETH)
    5 stocks (AMZN, GOOG, TSLA, MCD, XOM)
# Additional Explanations and Major Findings


# Conclusion
   In conclusion we determined that news does influence the world of finance and although we gathered a great amount of information we cannot conclude or accurately predict what a portfolio will do. This was made clear by the information we provided. We concluded that although we can chart the past, we have found it difficult to accurately predict the future of a given portfolio. Getting an understanding of the effects of news on the financial market has allowed us to better understand the different variables in play when news is happening to better predict what a financial portfolio will do. Questions we asked ourselves when diving into this project is Does news influence asset prices? What is it about the news that influences market prices? What is considered good news and what is bad news? How will CBDC impact my portfolio? Will money flow out of traditional markets into cryptocurrency markets? What is the news saying about the use of blockchain technology in the traditional market?
